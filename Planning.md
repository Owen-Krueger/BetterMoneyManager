# Better Money Manager

This is the *Better Money Manager*'s Planning Checklist/Requirements Document. This list consists of is requirements for a minimum viable product (MVP) and desired features for the program. This list will split sections into major releases, with the first chunk describing the features describing the first major release, the second describing the second major release, and so on.

This will be shown in the form of a checklist, with items being checked when completed. The item will have a ~~strikethrough~~ applied to it if the item has been removed from this release or removed entirely.

If you have a suggestion for a feature that should be added to BMM, please [open an issue above](https://github.com/Owen-Krueger/BetterMoneyManager/issues) to request the new feature. Please don't add it to this document. I will do that when I decide on the timeline for the new feature.
